# working in branches

You will probably want to use branches in your project. 

Once you have decided which feature to work on:
1. create a branch for that task/feature
1. update whatever is needed to feel confident that things is done
1. commit whenever you have something meaningful to say

Once you feel confident that your branch is ready for prime time, 
it is time to create a pull request to merge that branch back into 
master. Sometimes, you might want to create a pull request 
with review required. For example, your team may want to be able to 
check on work done by an individual or verify things have gone
according to plan. Pull requests and merging with the master branch give 
a strong sense of how different features are coming along and support
continuous integration meaningfully.
